Powerful application passwords manager for WordPress with role-based usage control and full analytics reporting capabilities.

== Description ==

**Keys Master** is a powerful application passwords manager for WordPress with role-based usage control and full analytics reporting about passwords usages. It relies on the "application password" core feature introduced in WordPress 5.6. and add it extra features and controls.

You can limit usage of application passwords, on a per role basis:

* maximum passwords per user;
* specific usage: none (blocks usage), only authentication and revocation or full management (with password creation).

For each roles defined on your site, you can define a period during which a password can be unused before auto-revocation.

**Keys Master** can report the following main items and metrics:

* KPIs: authentication success, number, creations and revocations of passwords, adoption and usage rate;
* channels breakdown;
* clients breakdown (requires the free [Device Detector](https://wordpress.org/plugins/device-detector/) plugin);
* countries breakdown (requires the free [IP Locator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip-locator/) plugin);
* site breakdowns in multisites environments.

**Keys Master** supports a set of WP-CLI commands to:
    
* manage WordPress application passwords (list, create and revoke) - see `wp help apwd password` for details;
* toggle on/off main settings - see `wp help apwd settings` for details;
* modify operations mode - see `wp help apwd mode` for details;
* display passwords statistics - see `wp help apwd analytics` for details.
